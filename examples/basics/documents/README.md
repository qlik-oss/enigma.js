# Basics: List apps in Sense QRS and open document

This example consists of two parts, the first part uses JWT to authenticate and fetch a list of apps from QRS,
and then enigma.js to connect to the first app found in that list.

## Prerequisites

You need to follow the instructions for JWT setup in your Sense Enterprise found in the
[JWT authentication example](/examples/authentication/sense-using-jwt#prerequisites).

Once JWT is set up, modify the code to match your environment (highlighted with comments in the
example code).

## Runnable code

* [QRS](./qrs.js)
