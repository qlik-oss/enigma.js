# Runnable examples

[Back to overview](../README.md#readme)

All examples in this directory should be runnable from a Node.js environment granted
you have a QIX Engine running locally (unless otherwise noted in the example).

All example categories should have a `README.md` file containing:

* High-level explanation (if needed)
* Prerequisites (if more than stated above)
* Instructions how to run (may be covered in Prerequisites)
* Link to: `[Back to examples](/examples/README.md#runnable-examples)`

Before getting started, you should run these commands in a terminal:

```bash
$ cd examples
$ npm install
```
